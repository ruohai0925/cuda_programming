  // CUDA provides built-in variables to identify threads in the execution grid:
  //
  // blockIdx.x: The index of the current CTA (block) within the grid in the x-dimension.
  //             Ranges from 0 to (NUM_BLOCKS - 1).
  //             Each CTA has a unique blockIdx.x value.
  //
  // blockDim.x: The dimension (number of threads) of a CTA in the x-dimension.
  //             This is the same as NUM_THREADS passed to the kernel launch.
  //             In this code: blockDim.x = 1024 (NUM_THREADS).
  //
  // threadIdx.x: The index of the current thread within its CTA in the x-dimension.
  //              Ranges from 0 to (blockDim.x - 1), i.e., 0 to 1023.
  //              Each thread within a CTA has a unique threadIdx.x value.
  //
  // Global thread ID formula: tid = (blockIdx.x * blockDim.x) + threadIdx.x
  // This calculates a unique ID for each thread across the entire grid.
  // Example: If blockIdx.x = 2, blockDim.x = 1024, threadIdx.x = 5,
  //          then tid = (2 * 1024) + 5 = 2053
  // This ensures each thread processes a different array element.

  //      (like shared memory). CTAs are organized into a grid.
  //      In CUDA syntax: <<<NUM_BLOCKS, NUM_THREADS>>>, NUM_BLOCKS is the number of CTAs,
  //      and NUM_THREADS is the number of threads per CTA.

  // CTAs per Grid (also called "blocks per grid")
  // Grid: The entire collection of CTAs launched for a kernel.
  //       A grid contains multiple CTAs, and each CTA contains multiple threads.
  // We need to launch at LEAST as many threads as we have elements
  // This equation pads an extra CTA to the grid if N cannot evenly be divided
  // by NUM_THREADS (e.g. N = 1025, NUM_THREADS = 1024)
  // Formula: (N + NUM_THREADS - 1) / NUM_THREADS ensures we have enough threads
  //          by rounding up the division (ceiling division).
  // similar to: ceil(N / NUM_THREADS)
  // ceil(N / NUM_THREADS): Rounds up the division to the nearest integer.
  //                        This ensures we have enough threads to cover all elements.
  //                        For example, if N = 1025 and NUM_THREADS = 1024,
  //                        ceil(1025 / 1024) = 2, so we need 2 CTAs.
